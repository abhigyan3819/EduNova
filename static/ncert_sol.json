            "answer": "Magnesium metal is very **reactive** and when stored, it reacts with atmospheric oxygen to form a thin, stable layer of **magnesium oxide** ($MgO$) on its surface. This oxide layer prevents the magnesium from reacting further. The ribbon is cleaned with sandpaper to remove this layer so that the reaction with oxygen (burning) can take place easily."

If water is added to a concentrated acid, the large amount of heat generated may convert the water added to **steam instantly**, which can cause the acid to **splash out** and cause severe burns.

This is because bases produce $OH^-$ ions in water, and adding more base (which is soluble) adds more $OH^-$ ions to the solution."

Treating the soil with basic compounds like quicklime ($CaO$), slaked lime ($Ca(OH)_2$), or chalk ($CaCO_3$) **neutralises** the excess acid, bringing the soil pH back to an optimal range for crop growth."

            "answer": "Copper is used instead of steel (iron alloy) for hot water tanks because:\n1. **High Reactivity of Iron:** Iron (in steel) **reacts with water/steam** to a large extent (rusting), especially at high temperatures, leading to corrosion.\n2. **Low Reactivity of Copper:** Copper **does not react with cold water, hot water, or steam** (even when left for a long time), making it highly resistant to corrosion in the tank.\n3. **Superior Heat Conduction:** Copper is a much **better conductor of heat** than steel, allowing for more efficient heating of the water."
